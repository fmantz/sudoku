# README

Try the CUDA sudoku solver. Unfortunately, I assume because of a lack of data parallelism, it is incredibly slow. 

* install CUDA
* Run by:

```bash
# build CUDA program
make

# run sudoku solver, output is printed in the CUDA version of the program to the console (solve first 10 sudokus)
./sudoku_cuda p096_sudoku.txt 10
```

More sudokus can be generated by: 

```bash
# download sudoku generator:
wget https://qqwing.com/qqwing-1.3.4.jar

# generate some test sudokus:
java -jar qqwing-1.3.4.jar --generate 1000 --difficulty expert --compact > sudoku.txt
```
